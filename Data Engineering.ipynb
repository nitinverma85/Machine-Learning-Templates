    "- Relational databases expand vertically as more data is added. Good for small data. \n",
    "- NoSQL databases expand horizontally. So, more machines can be added. Faster to retrieve.Good for large data. Is usually faster than Relational DB. More machine nodes increases speed (read/write) linearly. Does not support Joins, aggregations, etc. \n",
    "- SQL is still used where ACID transactions are required (like ensure all DBs are updated only if the whole banking transaction is complete). \n",
    "- Example of noSQL : Apache Cassandra (Similar to SQL but broken into multiple nodes), Mongo DB (Documents), DynamoDB (Key value), Apache HBase"
